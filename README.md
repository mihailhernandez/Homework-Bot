# HomeworkBot
--------------------------

### What's this bot all about?
HomeworkBot is an automated testing Java program that tests homeworks on GitHub and returns feedback.

### How does it work?
1. Provide JSON configuration file that has specifications of the repository, homework folders,
tasks to apply over each homework, etc.
2. The bot clones the repository and runs the tests over the given homeworks. After each homework test
the bot creates a new homework report on given homework tasks.
3. After the reports are made the bot adds the report files to the homework folders of the students.
